Basics

* https://youtu.be/i_LwzRVP7bg (~4 hours)
* What is machine learning
* Data preprocessing
* Supervised vs unsupervised learning
* Regression vs classification tasks
* Overfitting/underfitting
* Model evaluation/metrics (ex accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC, AUC)
* (Can maybe skip and dive right into neural networks, but these are fundamental ML algorithms to know):
    * Linear regression/logistic regression
    * Support Vector Machines
    * Decision trees (ex random forest)
    * Dimensionality reduction (ex PCA)
    * Clustering (ex K nearest neighbors)

Neural networks
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyWAvY2CF9c (~1.5 hours)
* Basics (ex nodes/weights/bias, what is an activation function, layers, etc)
* Perceptron/multilayer perceptron
* Hidden layers/deep neural networks
* Activation functions (ex sigmoid, tanh, relu, leaky relu)
* Loss functions (ex RMSE/cross entropy)
* Model training (forward pass/backpropagation/gradient descent)

Deep learning for image classification
* Convolutional neural network (ex convolutional layers, pooling, filters, stride, etc)
* UNet
* ResNet
* ImageNet
* Transfer learning
* RadImageNet
